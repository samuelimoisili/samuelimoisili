## Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm a lover of music 🎶 and art 🎨, and can often be found taking long walks in the city 🏙️. I'm a serial project starter 🚀 with a long list of unfinished ideas.

I may never finish all my projects, but at least I'm consistent! But who knows, maybe one day I'll actually finish one of them!😂 If you're looking for someone who's always willing to try something new and never afraid to fail, you've come to the right place.

Let's make something great together!

### 🎉 Fun facts:

- My favourite coding playlist includes the "Classical Mix" and "Indie Mix" playlists on Spotify.
- My favourite pass time is a long city walk through the streets of London, UK.
- I once spent an entire weekend building a chatbot to compare book prices (It still needs a little work...)

### 🚀 Skills:

- Python, Golang, JavaScript, and Java
- React, Node.js, and Flask
- AWS, GCP, Docker, and Kubernetes

### 🌱 Currently Learning:

- Rust and Kotlin
