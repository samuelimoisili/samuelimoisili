## Hi there! 👋🏻

I'm a lover of music 🎶 and art 🎨, and can often be found taking long walks in the city 🏙️. I'm a serial project starter 🚀 with a long list of unfinished ideas.

I may never finish all my projects, but at least I'm consistent! But who knows, maybe one day I'll actually finish one of them!😂 If you're looking for someone who's always willing to try something new and never afraid to fail, you've come to the right place.

Let's make something great together!

### 🎉 Fun facts:

- My favourite coding playlist includes the "Classical Mix" and "Indie Mix" playlists on Spotify.
- I believe that a good programmer is someone who looks both ways before crossing a one-way street.
- My mantra when building projects is if you fail, try, try again. And it begins to work out, abandon the project and start something new.
- When I'm not programming, you can find me taking long walks around the city, trying to come up with ideas for yet another abandoned project.
- They say that programming is a never-ending learning process, which is good news for me since I seem to forget everything I learned the minute I finish a project.
